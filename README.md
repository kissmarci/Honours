## Running the program
- By default, running main.py will evaluate the model and run the loss matrix analysis
- The trained model's state dictionary is already saved in /models/, and will be loaded by the model instead of retraining the model each time
- The model can be retrained by uncommenting the lines after #Training in main.py
